    <P>LET XI</P>

<P>Georgetown University Law Center<BR>
December 2-3, 2022<BR>
Submission deadline:<BR>
Monday, August 29, 2022</P>

<P>The Eleventh Annual Law and Economics Theory Conference (LET XI) will be held at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC starting on the morning of Friday, December 2, 2022 and ending in the early afternoon of Saturday, December 3, 2022.  This conference is intended to serve as a forum for presentation and discussion of current research on theoretical law and economics.  The nature of the conference over the past ten meetings has been that the paper should be a work in progress.  We can promise you a good discussion with supportive colleagues who are interested in formal models.</P>
<P>If you have a paper that you would like to present, please send a PDF file of the paper (or abstract, though reasonably complete papers are strongly preferred) no later than Monday, August 29, 2022 by email to Josh Teitelbaum at jct48@law.georgetown.edu.  Please include “LET XI” in the subject line.  The selection of papers to be presented at the conference, as well as of discussants, will be determined by a program committee chaired by Josh Teitelbaum.  The planned notification date is Monday, October 3, 2022. Presenters should then provide the paper they plan to present to their assigned discussant no later than Friday, November 11, 2022.  Travel funds, with some limitations, will be available for those on the program (presenters and discussants). A dinner will be held for all invited participants on Friday evening, and lunches will be provided on Friday and Saturday.  There will be an informal pre-conference dinner for presenters and discussants on Thursday evening.</P
<P>Details on hotel accommodations will be available in the fall. All conference details, including the program, will be posted at http://lawandeconomictheory.org.  We hope that participation in this conference will be of interest to you.  If you know of anyone who may not have received this message but who should be included, please forward the message and ask them to subscribe to the Law and Economic Theory mailing list at http://lawandeconomictheory.org.</P

    <P><B>Call for Papers: Tenth Annual Law and Economic Theory Conference</B></P>

    <P>The <B>Tenth Annual L&E Theory Conference</B> will be held at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law starting on the morning of Friday, December 3rd, and ending in the early afternoon of Saturday, December 4th.. This conference is intended to serve as a forum for presentation and discussion of current research on theoretical law and economics.  The nature of the conference over the past nine meetings has been that the paper should be a work in progress.  We can promise you a good discussion with supportive colleagues who are interested in formal models.</P>
    
<P>If you have a paper that you would like to present, please send a PDF file of the paper (or abstract, though reasonably complete papers are strongly preferred) <B>no later than September 11, 2021</B> by email to <A mailto:ezra-friedman@law.northwestern.edu>ezra-friedman@law.northwestern.edu</A>.  Please include “LET X” in the subject line. The selection of papers to be presented at the Conference, as well as of discussants, will be determined by the Organizing Committee (Ezra Friedman, Alex Lee, and several others).  The planned notification date is <B>October 11, 2021</B>; presenters should provide the paper they plan to present to their assigned discussant no later than <B>November 12th</B>.  Travel funds, with some limitations will be available for those on the program (presenters and discussants). At this point we are uncertain whether there will be any restrictions on international travel due to COVID. International participants will be asked to monitor any applicable government restrictions and keep us informed. A dinner will be held for all invited participants on Friday evening, and lunches will be provided on Friday and Saturday.  There will be an informal pre-conference dinner and drinks for presenters and discussants on the evening of Thursday, December 2.</P>
<P>Details on hotel accommodations will be available in the fall, and a web site for the conference will (hopefully) also be available at that time.  We hope that participation in this conference will be of interest to you.  If you know of anyone who may not have received this message but who should be included, please forward the message and ask them to sign up to the list at http://lawandeconomictheory.org.  (Unfortunately, we cannot sign people up to the list directly.) We are especially interested in hearing about younger scholars interested in law and econ theory.</P>
